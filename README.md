# App & REST API for serving random recipes

Express & React application that serves random recipes that users save on the app.

The app has user handling for, registration, login, logout, edit name & password, & delete. Same for recipes, users can create, edit and delete them.
You can fetch the recipes from the API but editing and creating needs a login key.
